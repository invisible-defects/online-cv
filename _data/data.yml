    title: Description
    summary: |
      Hello! My name is Alexander and I'm a Unity developer. I tend to constantly broaden my knowledge and study new technological and architectural approaches. 
      I take responsibility for code that I deliver, so I'm always trying to minimise the amount of "black boxes" and maintain understanding of the code on different 
      abstraction levels. I have experience of managing small-scale teams (up to 5 people in direction, up to 30-40 people in product team) and am quite good at 
      keeping a warm, friendly atmosphere while still accelerating tech-related pipelines and processes.
      
      Skills highlights:
        - Experience with various architectural approaches and patterns (MVx, ECS, GoF), follow industry best practices (SOLID, KISS, Clean Code). Good at designing project architecture, ensuring codebase and project structure consistency (code review, documentation, editor tools)
        - Experience with various Unity-related frameworks & tools (Zenject, UniTask, Addressables + remote assets, Shader Graph, Cinemachine, Protobuf), common tools & software (Git, Linux, Github Actions, Sentry, Docker, Jira)
        - Experience with development & performance optimisation for mobile platforms, including AR/VR
        - Advanced understanding and broad experience with C#, good knowledge of CS and math, experience with other languages and stacks (Python, JS, Golang, C++)
        - Good communication skills, able to create and sustain pipelines between directions, e.g. code <-> art
