    title: Description
    summary: |
      I'm a software developer focusing mainly on Unity / C# development. I also have experience of web development 
      (fullstack: React + golang / Python) & decentralized apps development (Solidity + JS / TS). 
      I'm quite good at working with Linux, Git, Docker. I'm familiar with ML / DL (Theano / TF), Jenkins, CircleCI, Sentry, Kubernetes. 
      My life dream is doing game development, so I am deeply committed to constant learning, exploring new technologies and design patterns.  
      I create small games and projects with friends and colleagues in my free time. Moreover, I sometimes contribute to open-source projects.
